# ImageToASCII
Takes an image file and produces an ASCII image of said file, is better using a monospace font

For a 1000 width ascii art it takes about 1MB and uses around 1Mill characters, 
to view use a text editor (personal preference notepad++), change font to a monospace font such as 'courier new' and zoom out.
